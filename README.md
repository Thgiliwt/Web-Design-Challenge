# Web-Design-Challenge
This is the 9th homework from my coding boot camp course.
This week is about designing a website. It requires so many codes and I was having an internet issue so I had to rush to complete it. Sadly there is not enough time so some of the features could not be achieved.

## Key Reflects

### New Findings
Bootstrap and Bootswatch come together to turn my webpage fancy. I used CDN methods to import them within the <head> part. There are totally 7 pages to build so my method is to create all of the pages (.html and .css) into there folders and focus on the index page first. Once it is done, the <head> and navbar parts could be copy and pasted.
I have used the 'carousel' within the index page to replace the default pure image of the temperature. Now all 4 figures are automatically playing.
Webpage settings, such as the grid system, block positioning etc. are very easy to understand individually but when they come together, there will be so many adjustment to go... Not sure how does the 'front-end' web developer usually do the job lol.

### Uncertainties
1. Within 'Data Page', somehow my table does not showing the 'striped' and 'hover' features. Can't figure out why.
2. Webpage color doesn't fit for my theme...
